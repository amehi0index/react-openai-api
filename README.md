## Description

This application allows a user to enter a list of primary ingredients from their unique hot sauce recipe as a text prompt. Submitting the input sends the prompt to the OpenAI API, which returns a list of unique names for the product based on the provided ingredients. 

The application uses localStorage to save the user's list of unique hot sauce names, and a proxy server to facilitate requests to OpenAI API.
